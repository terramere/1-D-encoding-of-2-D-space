# 1-D-encoding-of-2-D-space
Use of Morton sequencing to encode 2-D space at multiple scales for a Bi-Gram Language Model to generate trajectories
Best to run in Collab as for higher resolution grids it uses float128 which is not supported in many systems
Load tiger_transform_IJGIS.ipynb into Collab .
Upload files tiger_points_anon.xxx (5 files) into the work area
Load morton1.ipynb into your GOOGLE Drive
Run tiger_transform_IJGIS.ipynb
The first frame has the level set at 6, you can change this and run again.
You can also change the seed to get different results for each run at a given level
